 @file e3DHW_hardware_data.1.2.scad
 Collection of hardware data, used by many e3DHW libraries.
 These data are function of the commercial hardware found, but also of the printer tolerances.
 Keeping this data here, it is possible to optimize them on the 3D printer and on the filament.\n
 All e3DHW libraries will share this optimized values.
 
@par Hardware
    \li M3 screws are the most used
    \li Parker self tapping screws requires a pilot hole
    \li Engraved text parameters fit well here
